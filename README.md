This is a simple calculator. I used javascript for this. There are lots of javascript calculator available in the realm of web world. What makes it difference. It has a log history which is not an unique feature but at least it has little different than other stereotype calculator. And highly optimised code. No plugin required to use this.

1. Log History 
2. No third party plugin required
3. Highly optimize code
